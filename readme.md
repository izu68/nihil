For now a pretty basic and WIP Mega Drive "engine" I'm making for personal use.

### Toolchain

Assembler: `vasm-psi-x`, a version of vasm that tries to mimic asm68k's syntax. Essentially like using the old asm68k but can produce ELF objects. This is maintained by NaotoNTP, go check his GitHub.

Compiler: `m68k-elf-gcc`, the GNU C Compiler targeted towards m68k. Maintained by andwn, check his repo as well.
