For now a pretty basic and WIP Mega Drive "engine" I'm making for personal use.

### Toolchain

Assembler: [vasm-psi-x](https://github.com/NaotoNTP/vasm-psi-x), a version of vasm that tries to mimic asm68k's syntax. Essentially like using the old asm68k but can produce ELF objects. Maintained by NaotoNTP.

Compiler: [m68k-elf-gcc](https://github.com/andwn/m68k-gcc-toolchain), the GNU C Compiler targeted towards m68k. Maintained by andwn.

Go check them out!!
